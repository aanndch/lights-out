# Lights Out
LightsOut is based on a deceptively simple concept. Clicking on a cell toggles that cell and each of its immediate neighbors. The goal is to turn out all the lights, ideally with the minimum number of clicks. There is a fairly easy method for solving the puzzles, but it will very rarely result in the minimum number of moves.
